I love a good challenge. I love the feeling when the brain sparks and screeches trying to solve another mistery. For several years I've been solving all sorts of nutcracking challenges, and for several months I've been thinking of creating one myself. Luckily, I have just the resources for that: a personal website and a blog. And finally, we are here. Welcome, to the hatedabamboo's ARG:2025!

## What is ARG?

ARG (Alternate reality game) is a two in one: an intellectual challenge and a game. It brings fun, excitement, lots of frustration and overwhelming amount of satisfaction when you solve the puzzle. Being an alternate reality game, it spans not only throughout the virtual space -- but also in a real world. But fret not! You won't have to travel to a distant place to find a piece of paper with the next clue. All of the tasks in the ARG:2025 can be solved simply by having access to the internet.

## General information

The ARG:2025 consists of several tasks. Each task leads to the next one. There is no way to hop over several tasks to the last one or to brute force your way through.

The official webpage for ARG:2025 is [hatedabamboo.me/arg2025](https://hatedabamboo.me/arg2025/). On the page there is a timer. When the timer reaches zero, the first clue will appear -- and the challenge will start.

The tasks are designed to be complex, but not unsolvable. Some of them may be easier then the others. If you find yourself thinking that the task is unsolvable and the coding is incorrect -- you're most likely trying the wrong answer. The tasks have been tested several times and are working properly.

I understand that we live in 2025 and damned clankers are everpresent. And I can't forbid you to use them -- it's solely up to you. The only thing I ask of you -- try to actually think about the task at hand and adhere to clankers only as the last resort. However, even they might not be useful enough to help you solve the task. I've tried to reverse-engineer the tasks and man they suck.

## Rewards

I designed ARG:2025 in such a way that there can be only one winner. The first person to solve all the tasks will recieve a specific message that will allow me to uniquely identify the winner.

Unfortunately, this is not the most transparent way to communicate with the participants regarding the status of solving the challenge: there is no leaderboard, no timeframe. This time there will be only one winner. After the winner has solved all the challenges, the ARG:2025 pages will be updated commemorating the person and telling all others that the challenge is complete. Additionally, a post will be published here finalizing the challenge and  (hopefully) showing some statistics. Should the stars align, the next challenge (I hope there will be next!) will be more advanced in this regard.

Now for some fun.

::: info Prize

    The prize for the winner is quite nominal: **$50 coupon** for amazon.com.

:::

For winner's convenience, it can be changed to a coupon of equal amount in a different store (allegro.pl, store.steampowered.com, etc.) to avoid the situations when the desired marketplace is blocked in the winner's country of residence.

The prize is very timid, but I think the real joy brings solving all the challenges and having fun along. I most certainly did.

## Tips and tricks

If you find yourself annoyed that the main page of the challenge loads so slow, add the following parameter to the url: `?typingSpeed=1`. This will increase the speed with which the text appears on the screen. The smaller the number -- the faster the speed.

If you find a bug or think that the task is wrong or unsolvable, please contact me via the email at the bottom of this page.
