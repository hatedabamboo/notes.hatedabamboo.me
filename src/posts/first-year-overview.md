Exactly one year ago, on August 24, 2023, I published my first blog post. Since then, one year has passed, 14 posts have been written, and some other events have happened. I love numbers, so I decided to gather some statistics for the past year and publish them here for your, dear reader, joy, and my own clarity.

Numbers are cool and all, but they're much cooler when they look nice. So here's an infographic I found on the internet filled with numbers related to my blog.

## Year in numbers 202{3,4}

## Afterthought

Pretty neat, right?

Overall, I can't say this data satisfies or dissatisfies me. This blog is a personal hobby project, mostly dedicated to the education of my fellow engineers and associates. If someone found something new and helpful while reading my publications, my heart is happy.

I wish I had posted more. Often, I have the urge to write something, but my laziness (and video games) usually overtake me. Also, I still think most of the topics I could write about are not interesting, very basic, well-known, and discussed many times. This stops me from publishing more, because finding an actually interesting topic (in my view) takes a significant amount of time.

Anyway, I'm glad to see this blog grow and attract visitors. I hope the following year will be even more eventful.
