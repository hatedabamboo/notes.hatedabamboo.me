![Bad advices from the start](/assets/walkietalkie.webp)

Being an engineer is great, but apparently I can’t stop talking about it. So I began speaking at community events and meetups, mostly about cloud, DevOps, and all things IT. Here are some of my talks:

## Database Migration: Through Thorns to RDS

*Level 200 (Intermediate) • [Sessionize](https://sessionize.com/s/hatedabamboo/database-migration-through-thorns-to-rds/149211)*

This talk tells a real‑world story of migrating a sizable on‑premises PostgreSQL database to AWS RDS using AWS DMS (Database Migration Service) and SCT (Schema Conversion Tool). I discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both services and explain how they can (or can’t) help you with database migrations. By walking through the migration process step by step, I highlight common pitfalls and obstacles such as missing defaults, constraint violations, schema mismatches, and sequence‑handling issues that often catch teams off guard. Along the way, I share practical lessons learned, including strategies for effective pre‑migration planning, testing, and validation, as well as tips for blending automated tools with manual adjustments to ensure a smooth, reliable transition to the cloud.

## Everything* as Code

*Level 100 (Foundational) • [Sessionize](https://sessionize.com/s/hatedabamboo/everything-as-code/149210) • [Article](https://notes.hatedabamboo.me/almost-everything-as-code/)*

In this session, I guide you through the fascinating world of “everything as code.” We start with the foundations -- basic software -- and gradually build up to modern practices like Configuration as Code, Infrastructure as Code, and even Observability as Code. Along the way, we trace how the idea of codifying concepts has evolved, showing how it brings reliability, consistency, and automation to everyday work.

Expect a light-hearted lecture with a natural, story-like flow rather than a dry deep dive. Throughout the journey, I show practical demo examples that connect the dots and show how these approaches work in real life. Whether you’re new to these ideas or already familiar with them, you’ll walk away with a clearer picture of why “as code” is more than just a buzzword -- and how we arrived at where we are today.
