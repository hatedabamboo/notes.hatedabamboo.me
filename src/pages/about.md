Hello! I'm Kirill, and this is my blog. I write mostly about AWS, Linux, security, CTFs and the operational side of IT. It's built using [11ty](https://11ty.dev) and hosted on GitHub Pages (for now). You can read a (semi-obsolete) story of how it was created in [this article](/landing-and-blog).

If you'd like to subscribe to updates, you can use [RSS](/feed.xml) or my [Telegram channel](https://t.me/hatedabamboo_notes). If you feel generous or want to enjoy my blog in a dark theme, consider a small donation via [Buy Me A Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/hatedabamboo) (or a beer).

You can find my website [here](https://hatedabamboo.me) with all the necessary information and other social links.
