Hello! I'm Kirill, and this is my humble blog, where I jot down various notes about my daily experiences: from nontrivial tasks to interesting challenges and anything else that sparks excitement.

The initial idea originated from my passion for taking notes using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). However, over time, I realized that some of my notes could be useful not only to me but also to others. And that's how my online notebook came to be.

You can find my website [over here](https://hatedabamboo.me) with all the necessary information and other social links.
