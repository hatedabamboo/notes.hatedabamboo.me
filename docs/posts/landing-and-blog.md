A short story about why I decided to create a personal website and blog and how
I set them up and got them running. (Which turned into a manual on how to create
a static website with S3 + HTTPS + custom domain name and blog for it using
GitHub Pages).

!!! warning "17.06.2024 update"

    On June 17 I switched blog platform from Jekyll to Material for MkDocs
    (with which I'm very happy for now). Because of this some parts of this
    post became obsolete. I'm pretty sure some time in the future I'll update
    this post with all the new information, or write a separate one regarding
    reasons behind this transition and transition itself. We'll see.

## Introduction

Long ago, in a galaxy far, far away, I was a simple datacenter engineer without
a big necessity to write notes and store them somewhere. Time passed, my career
progressed, and as I became more experienced in systems administration and
expanded the array of tools and technologies I worked with, I came to the
conclusion that having a `notes.txt` in my home directory wouldn't be enough.
While I still kept a physical notebook on my table, there were times when I'd
forget it, leaving me without necessary notes in the middle of a thought
process. Not cool.

Somewhere around this time, I discovered a wonderful note organizer called
Obsidian[^1] through my colleagues. From there, things
started moving forward. I began using it not only for professional notes but
also for personal ones. It proved to be very handy, especially during the
preparation for certifications, whether it was AWS, Hashicorp Terraform, or
others (I'm looking at you, CKA). It's like having your own personal Wikipedia.

As the need to write notes grew, I also realized that my notes might be (or
might not be) useful to someone else — people on the internet. Boy, how many
blogs I pass through every day! Considering all these factors, I decided to
finally create one (and also a landing page, because why not).

## Blog: how, why and where

I don't associate my notes here with the word "blog", but it seems like this is
the most convenient term for it.

When I thought about the platform and approach for my blog and landing page, I
decided that it should be as simple as possible (KISS[^2],
as they say). That's why choosing GitHub Pages seemed like the most obvious
solution. The platform has built-in functionality to deploy a website using the
very popular existing engine. I wouldn't have to worry about deploying pipelines
(ha-ha, DevOps engineer wouldn't like to set up another pipeline). The main
language for notes is Markdown, and it's already a git repository. Every commit
will trigger the pipeline, deploy fresh changes, and display fresh posts in
just a minute. GitOps[^3] in its full
glory! What more could one wish for?

And that's how this blog was created. GitHub has a very nice and thorough
manual[^4] for the process of creating a personal blog,
which is exactly what I followed.

Some customization has been made, primarily with a custom domain name (which I
find very good). GitHub has a manual[^5] for this case as
well. But as I recall correctly, all I did was select the "**Custom domain**"
option in the "**Pages**" menu of the repository settings and paste my custom
domain for this blog. After a few minutes, when GitHub checked DNS
availability, I enabled the "**Enforce HTTPS**" option. You know, a secure web,
all that stuff.

And that's it! It sounds easy enough, and it was exactly that way. Until I
decided to add some customizations for the Jekyll engine (theme, tags, archive,
images). This is where the true nature of Jekyll started to reveal itself.

Jekyll is cool and simple, yes. But its modules (supported by GitHub Pages) are
outdated, sometimes even abandoned. This leads to frustrating situations where
you have to reinvent the wheel instead of just adding some parameters and
modules and doing a git push. Adding tags and a post archive took me about 3
hours and approximately 50 commits to the repository (GitOps, you know). Not to
mention that the default theme for Jekyll, minima[^6], has
been out of development for 4 years already. And to use its latest version (3),
you'll have to improvise, because you can't simply set it in the Gemfile, as
it's not in the repository. To configure the latest minima theme, I had to
include it in a separate setting in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
remote_theme: jekyll/minima
```

So yeah, if you're planning to set up a blog on GitHub Pages, you need to keep
that in mind.

## O landing! My landing!

Now, for the fun part — the landing!

As an AWS user and practitioner, I decided from the start that I wanted to use
S3 static website hosting for my landing. Why? I don't like overcomplicating
things with unnecessary JavaScript and a web server where it's not necessary.
After all, what is a landing page if not a static webpage, right? Besides, with
simple HTML and a minimal amount of CSS and assets, my webpage loads in around
300–400 ms. Take that, modern bloatweb!

!!! note

    Initially, I intended to describe what I did during the creation and configuration of
    my landing page, but in the end, it turned out to be instructions on how to create your
    own.

    So be it.

### Domain name

I began by selecting the appropriate web address for my websites. This was an
easy task, considering I have a rather unique nickname. The most challenging
part was deciding on the top-level domain name. I contemplated options like
`.dev`, `.io`, and `.boo`, but while browsing the Route 53 name registration
service, I stumbled upon `.me` and ultimately chose it.

I purchased the domain through GoDaddy, and… Well, that's where things came to
a halt. For a while

### Static website hosting

To successfully serve a website on S3 you have to create an S3 bucket, enable
"**Static website hosting**" setting in the "**Properties**" menu, choose an
index page (`index.html` by default) and allow public access to it. Here's what
the policy would look like:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket-name>/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

!!! tip

    For future convenience, you should name the bucket the same as your website address.

With these steps, you can already upload `index.html` to the bucket, and the
website will be accessible. The only downside is that the address would look
something like `http://my-cool-bucket.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`. Not
very representative, amirite? But for this very reason, I purchased a domain,
and I'm not afraid to use it!

### Configuring custom domain name for static website

To host your static website on your domain name, you will need to:

1. Set up hosted zone on Route 53
2. Create a CloudFront distribution
3. Configure an HTTPS certificate using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

#### 1. Hosted zone on Route 53

Go to the AWS Web Console's Route 53 section, select the "**Hosted zones**"
menu, and click the "**Create hosted zone**" button. The domain name should
match the one you registered with your domain registrar (in my case, GoDaddy),
and choose the "**Public**" type so that everyone can access it.

This will create a hosted zone with several DNS records in it. I don't remember
all of them, but I believe they will include *A*, *NS*, and *SOA* records.

Now that we've created the hosted zone, you might wonder how to associate it
with your domain. After all, they are managed by different companies, right?
That's a great question! To allow AWS to handle DNS requests for your website,
you'll need to go to your registrar's domain portfolio, select your domain
name, and find the "**Nameservers**" setting. You'll need to change them to the
ones created by the hosted zone in Route 53 – specifically, the *NS* records.
They should look like this:

```text title="Domain names"
ns-2048.awsdns-64.com
ns-2049.awsdns-65.net
ns-2050.awsdns-66.org
ns-2051.awsdns-67.co.uk
```

After taking these actions, all DNS settings and configurations will be under
your control and managed through AWS in Route 53.

Alright, with that in place, let's configure our domains!

#### 2. CloudFront distribution

Open CloudFront in the AWS Web Console. Click on the "**Create a CloudFront
distribution**" big yellow button.

For "**Origin domain**", choose the resource you want to distribute, in our
case, it's the S3 bucket. Select it. After this step, a yellow box will appear,
suggesting you choose the website endpoint. I skipped this because it disabled
the HTTPS option for serving, which I didn't like.

Set "**Origin access**" to Public, of course.

Other settings I selected were enabling "**HTTP/3**" and disabling "**IPv6**".

For "**Custom SSL certificate**", you can configure it later, which is
precisely what we'll do.

This distribution we created will distribute our website. To accomplish this,
we need to configure Route 53 to route requests for our domain name (website
address) to this distribution.

Go back to Route 53, to your hosted zone, and create a new record. This time it
will be an *A* record. You can leave the subdomain name empty as it is the root
of our website. Set "**Record type**" to *A*. Click on "**Alias**" and select
"**Alias to a CloudFront distribution**". Choose the one you created earlier
and save it.

Now we need to take a small step back. The World Wide Web typically prefixes
`www` at the start of each website for a reason, so we should comply with this
convention and serve these requests as well. It's quite simple, though.

All you have to do is create another S3 bucket, this time with the name of the
website preceded by `www`. Like this: `www.your-cool-website.com`. All the
permission settings are the same as mentioned before, except for
the static website hosting configuration, which should be enabled, and
"**Hosting type**" should be set to redirect requests to your main bucket
(without `^www.`).

Find your CloudFront distribution and edit the settings. Under "**Alternate
domain name (CNAME)**", add the second address (with the `^www.`) and save it.

Navigate to Route 53 and your hosted zone. Create a new *A* record, similar to
the previous one, but this time enter www as the subdomain. Set it as an alias
for the same CloudFront distribution and save it.

Well done! You've configured your bucket, DNS, and CloudFront distributions.
The last thing remaining is to enable TLS for your website.

This is the schema of the whole process:

![Schema](../assets/2023-09-30-landing-and-blog/2023-09-30-landing-and-blog-scheme.webp){ loading=lazy }

#### 3. HTTP and S

!!! info

    As every P in the name of something IT-related stands for "Protocol" and
    L for "Language", S stands for "Secured".

Locate the Certificate Manager in the AWS Web Console. Here's the tricky part:
if your region is different from *us-east-1* (N. Virginia), your certificates
won't be visible in CloudFront. Change the region to *us-east-1* and proceed.
Request a new public certificate. The Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) should
be your website's name. Enter both of them in the fields. Choose DNS
validation, as it will enable you to automatically create CNAME records in
Route 53 for your domain and verify their validity.

Now you can go back to CloudFront, edit your distribution, and select your
newly acquired  "**Custom SSL certificate**" from the dropdown menu. Save it,
and your own personal website with  HTTPS ~~and hookers~~ is ready to go!

#### 4. GitOps here, GitOps there

Even a static website may require updates from time to time. Being a DevOps
engineer, I wanted to set up a deployment pipeline (and get some practice with
GitHub Actions).

In the deployment pipeline, there are three simple steps for the process:

1. Commit changes to the repository
2. Upload fresh files to S3

However, I was waiting for the changes to appear on the webpage for some time
until it dawned on me: CloudFront is a CDN, and it caches the page on edge
locations. This leads us to step 1, but actually 3:

3. Invalidate updated files

It's as simple as that. The most interesting part looks like this:

```yaml
- name: Invalidate stale pages
  run: |
    files=$(git diff --name-only HEAD HEAD~1 | grep source | sed 's/source//')
    aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
    --distribution-id ${{ secrets.DISTRIBUTION_ID }} \
    --paths $files
```

Here, I check for changes in the actual website pages for the latest commit and
invalidate those files using `awscli`. It's simple yet effective, and I find
this part very satisfying.

You can find the complete pipeline in the repository[^7] for my website.

#### 5. Costs

All in all, this setup is mostly covered by the AWS Free Tier. The only things
that cost money are the yearly domain name price, hosted zone, and taxes. My
total cost for a year is expected to be **$25**: $20 for the domain name and $5
for AWS services (I hope so). Overall, it's quite affordable, I would say.

### Configuring blog domain name

This step is quite straightforward. Create two new *CNAME* records in your
hosted zone with the desired subdomain (one with `^www.` and one without) and
configure them to redirect requests to your GitHub Pages domain
(`somethingsomething.github.io`), which you will enter in the "**Value**"
field. This new subdomain should then be entered in the "**Custom domain**"
field in the "**Pages**" menu of your repository settings.
