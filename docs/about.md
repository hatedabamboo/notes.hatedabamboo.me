Hello! I'm Kirill, and this is my humble blog, where I jot down various notes
about my daily experiences: from nontrivial tasks to interesting challenges and
anything else that sparks excitement.

The initial idea originated from my passion for taking notes using
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md){:target="_blank"}. However, over time, I
realized that some of my notes could be useful not only to me but also to
others. And that's how my online notebook came to be.

You can find my website [over here](https://hatedabamboo.me){:target="_blank"}
with all the necessary information and other social links.

## Not by AI

For several months, this icon has been awkwardly dangling at the bottom of each
page, signaling that this blog is written by an actual leather human and not a
silicon brain. I decided to move it to this page because the inability to
vertically align the picture with the updated footer drove me nuts.

So what does that mean exactly?

I use ChatGPT for grammar checks and occasionally when a sentence feels like
it’s not coming together properly. All the other elements -- structure, text,
wording, phrases -- are produced solely by me, however awkward and weird they
may sound. This blog is fully a product of my writing skills, which may even
improve over time (or not).

Oh, yes, here’s the picture:
